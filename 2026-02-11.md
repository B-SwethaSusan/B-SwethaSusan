esther: 2 completed
y:
Discussion with Karthik Mangu regarding his work.
.Discussed with Prathyusha about the features I want for single-point energy calculations.
Integrating single point energy calculations in the backend.
t:
stopped case study
file is not uploading to storage
Preparing api end points to full stack
SPE can be deployed

Boltzyme:
Vyshnavi :
y:
Setup and modifications in proteinmpnn pipeline
Looked into the function based enzyme generation issue

t:
pipeline stucked
run 1st pipeline

issues:
tools are not functioning
have some edge case issues
time not given for issues
2 pipelines
case study 1
hurrying
if time given
50% tools iin god manner
friday- documentation
facing error, system crash, another tasks, modifications more,different research 

Rajesh:
y:
started md on the top candidates of the boltzgen pipeline
Identified the camsol issue in new RFD2 pipeline.
Researched for the alternatives of camsol.
fixed bugs in RFD2 pipeline

t:
some new tools giving fake results
new tools searching and usage
new pipeline implementation
study research papers
not getting proper results for pipelines
No working models build in market
pipelines also limites
not resolving the issue of failure of work, shifting to another work for weekly
outputs mush be perfect.

RNA Bolt:
IMran:
y:
run a workflow
referance molecule , have an issue with the molecule, searching for refrences

t:
finalize reference molecule and run the workflow
searching tools for workflow
half life model archite ture change

issues:
1024 sequences only rhofold , making it flec=xible
correct input - correct output
7 tools
trying to update tools internally
max open source, oem property models
want response from case studies
confuse in finding models and reference
1 case studies- 2 workflows
2nd case study -in progress, if not get good results , will oprimize
1 property model build, 2nd in progress as of the data
lack of resources, resource papers not publishing, unable to find the referrances,not clear processes


Maria:
y:
researching for the 2nd case, found one sequence, need to run
founf reference sequence
t:
search for tools and tools inputs
objetives

issues:
2 case studies
4 workflows
research is taken time
rna- resources and references are limited
tools are limited,difference in time of work
other works are also coming in middle
completely need to focus on single
checking and validating evrything needs time


Boltpro:
y:
Ran BoltzGen to generate ~1500 designs for the SME-provided target protein.
Extracted PDBs from SPURS and StabDDG boltz outputs for DiffAb-generated sequences and shared them with SME for PRODIGY analysis.
Conducted research on antibody optimization models beyond DiffAb.
Finalized the AbOpt and AbMEGD approach after reading and analyzing the paper.
Verified the AbMEGD GitHub repository and noted that pretrained weights are not available.
Created a conda environment for AbOpt and initiated the first-step input design workflow.

t:
solve issues
optimization pipeline for antibody
implement PPI flow


issues:
bolt2, boltz issues- priority
pipeline 6-7 tools
last week client work, case studies this week only
no delay in tools
sme are getting are more other works , no time for research so lack of complete knowlwdge,not getting efficient work.
case studies- client case studies, max protein , antibodies, min protein in progress nanobody
issue solving not upto ai team, will focus experimentation.if not work get results because the tools are not built by us.

Dileep:
y:
Documented the benchmarking results of the RFdiffusion3 fine-tuning process and shared the consolidated findings.
Verified the outputs generated from the PxDesign experiments and summarized the best-performing results.
Set up a secondary pipeline using Boltz, prepared the required CSV inputs from the AntiBMMPNN-generated data, and initiated execution of the workflow.

t:
run pipeline for benchmarking
tool implement
px design tool implemented


issues:
se3 bind not tested, px design , run prodig
1 pipeline
3 models done
after benchmark will push
unable to focus on one work because of multiple works

Laxmi:
y:
Ran PRODIGY on DiffAb-generated variants and SPuRS outputs for the client project to estimate binding affinities and shortlist promising candidates.
Researched antibody optimization and docking tools, specifically AbDesign and AbDock, for potential integration into the optimization pipeline.
Recorded and shared one video of the platform tools with the business team.

t:
video recording
metrics and tools details

issues:
2 case studies
3 workflows
run some tools in front end and backend for workflows
4 pipelines with different tools, antibody pipelines need to be changes
need some time to research and also pure science person for guidance
prior intimation and time should be from business team
business team tell everything in prior

Rebolt:deep research alpha version
y:
Had meeting with Professor Rambabu sir and discussed on the deep research agent and patent extraction pipelines.
Worked on improving the performance of deep research agent by trying out different llms like gpt-oss-120b, qwen3, gemini 2.5 flash, grok 4 fast and reduced the searches.
We brainstromed about the R group pipeline and then thought of making little modifications to the pipeline.
t:
test the inputs given by rambabu sir
patent extraction pipeline R group
changes in code for deep research

issues:
pipelines- deep research, condition generation
models - expermented 10-15 models
only server issues


joel
t:
deep research deployment 
patent extraction r group experimentation
given condition generation

issues:
pipelines- experimented multiple nearly 4 for patent extraction
all good with 
need to check issues
more dependency
priorities changing
need sme
