continue on the case study

Boltzyme:
Srivani:
y:
Started extracting corresponding SMILES and sequences from the downloaded databases.
Encountered repeated PDB errors from RFdiffusion v3 (rfd3) outputs; began troubleshooting by generating multiple corrected input files.
Performed structure prediction for the PDBs shared by Aswini Ma’am

T:
data clean into single csv, will create
coordinate with dr sharvanandh- university of hyderabad- wet lab validations

solve - done
EZ specificity error not solved
act seek env setup, implemented
written main file
node api clashes fixes

t:
docker building


Rajesh:
chroma pipeline, need license
RFd3 use pipeline set- need to deploy

Boltchem:eod will complete, screening library part- into the platform, library proper 
maintanance 
ankith:
In gpu ivf method is working good
mv mole kit


Gopi:
plan experimnets to do
build a model chem prop
property prediction, generation
implementing the tools for shradha

shradha:
completed 1 case study
screening part, test on another libraries
put in github raise a issue
structure based generation 

catherene:
benchmarking focus
case studies
helped with grants
benchmarking pushed into md file


RNA Bolt:need to participate in challaenge
Imran:
pending in case studies
dowloading the dataasets taking time
changed components in tools, adding some extra files in output
translation prediction metrics


Maria:understanding the process of wet lab
y:
validating the results
Found miRNA databases
Studying foundational model (Struct-RFM)
Searching databases for RNA properties

t:
designing case studies and finding problem statemnets


Boltpro:
nagajyothi:
do some optimizations, make sure proteins are expressed, get information from aswini
, work on binders
y:
Combined synthetic complexes generated across all systems and created ~2000 synthetic complexes for RFdiffusion3 fine-tuning.
Set up filtering code using ipSAE, pLDDT, and ipTM; strict thresholds yielded 4 complexes, while moderate filtering produced 97 complexes.
Read the MBER paper to understand de novo antibody generation and filtering strategies.
Generated ESM and ProtBERT masked embeddings to support Aswini’s work.
Ran the Mosaic pipeline locally to generate structural outputs for given target.

t:
work on the rf3 diffusion for release



Dileep:
y:
Encountered system-level setup challenges on one system 16 and migrated the development workflow to an system 10.
Successfully completed the environment setup and dependency configuration on the system 10.
Established and verified the core RFdiffusion pipeline to ensure readiness for further experimentation and fine-tuning.

t:
currate some more data
run rf3 diffusion with curated data


Laxmi:list all the challenger and share today, plan other case studies
y:
frontend experimentation of case study
Researched few nanobody tools
Documentation of DenV case study

t:
business team want case study for client meeting
challenges facing
started with case study experimentation

Samitha:
rent and run experimentation
A meeting tomorrow
mention the instruments not the budget

Rebolt:share experimentation plan, condition restructure
do pdf
, conditions, give names not smiles
deep research modules-integrate,llm host, if inhouse need to do found some platforms
resolved changing the names
patent exraction- VLLM segregate and send
tongyi deep research add xi

PCB Bolt:send final plan in .md file
Divya: send model to sir
explored surrogate models for thermal analysis using deep learning and ml.


Manjunath :drc issues send
tested the agent with different files and later started working on the si simulation as per the inputs given
objectives, plan of validation

jathin
Downloading the datasheets from the STmicroelectronics and currently working on nxp semiconductors and infeneon technologies websites
t:website navigation issues
