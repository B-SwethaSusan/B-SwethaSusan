Ran StabDDG on DV87 to generate ~100,000 CDR variants for the client project as part of affinity and stability optimization.
Identified two binder-design targets from literature, along with their epitopes and sequences, for benchmarking binder generation workflows.
Cleaned and preprocessed target structures (PDB/CIF) and saved them for downstream computational analysis. The goal is to generate binders using multiple tools (PXDesign, Boltzgen, PPIFlow, RFdiffusion3) to later compare their outputs and efficiency in binder design.
Initiated the computational scFv pipeline design to standardize generation and evaluation workflows.


t:
verify the results from px design

Dileep:
Compared the fine-tuned RFdiffusion3 model against the base RFdiffusion3 in terms of backbone generation quality and structural characteristics.
Implemented an AntiBMMPNN → RF3 → IPSAE pipeline to generate and evaluate predictions using the fine-tuned RFdiffusion3 model.
Conducted experiments with the PxDesign pipeline by running evaluations across multiple input configurations.

t:
issues with the existing pipeline 
design new ppipeline
research on new pipeline for terptic proteins
