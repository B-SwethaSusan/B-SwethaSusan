going through platform case studies, what all changes in need in future
issues in running case study
sem asked for some input sent

t:
pcp grant completed
see for case study for anti body
see with platform 

RNA Bolt:
Imran:
Y:
Case study ecosystem setup- done 
run one work flow for 2 genes
result filtration is done
for final sequences need to do analysis

t:
tools and system setup 
with the ecosystem try with different pipelines
analyse the results , also try adding tools


maruia:
y:
researching deeper into the case study for validation 
v
t:
try different pipelines for case sudy on Sirna


Boltpro:
Dileep:
y:
Compare fine-tuned vs base model results
Benchmarking
Designed and executed an inference pipeline using the fine-tuned model in combination with ProteinMPNN; however, the resulting performance did not show significant improvement.
Iteratively evaluated alternative workflows by integrating AntiBMPNN with RF3 and IPASE, and constructed a separate pipeline combining AntiBMPNN, Boltz-2, and IPSAE.
Systematically assessed and compared the outputs from these workflows to evaluate the performance and limitations of the fine-tuned model.

t:
document the results 
run new pipeline 

nagajyothi:
t:
aswini gave a work- have to complete
boltz2 is running



run pipeline for optimization
setup tools in pipeline and run

Laxmi:
tools needed for optimizzation given
resarch on other theeptic protein piepleine
resarch on tools and come up with pipeline

Rebolt:
y:
t:
experiment 2 different LLms
deep research validation
2nd module need to be tested

boltz fix and update and do kernal optimization
see for time in building section



blockers:
every launch api testing for every module - gpu large should be availble , more gpu nodes, cpu is sufficient, if clients dont use fast completeion other wise pending
if not :
code is ready when ever completed will generate reports
when ever there is a availablility will test and generate reports
script is ready once check with srinivas and devops will give report

t:
frontend testing and see issues
