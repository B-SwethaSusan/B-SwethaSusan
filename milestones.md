# Quarterly Milestones – Project Management Execution Plan
## “Professional Output, Healthy Culture.”
---

## 1. Speed Up Execution

### Approach
- Break all work into 2-week sprints  
- Define a clear sprint goal  
- Lock scope once the sprint starts  
- Enforce a strict Definition of Done (DoD)

### How I Handle the Situation
- Resolve or escalate blockers within 24 hours  
- If new work comes mid-sprint:
  - Assess criticality  
  - Defer non-critical items to the next sprint  

### How I Behave Smartly
- Protect developers from last-minute changes  
- Focus on finishing work instead of starting new tasks  

### Process I Use / Improve
- Strengthen the existing sprint process with clear DoD checks:
  - Code merged  
  - Tests passed  
  - Docs updated  
  - Issue closed  

### Outcome
- Faster execution  
- Fewer incomplete tasks  
- Predictable delivery timelines

## 2. Project Management Efficiency Metrics

### Approach
- Track productivity of both myself and the teams using data-driven metrics  

### Metrics
- **Sprint Velocity** → Story points completed  
- **Lead Time** → Issue opened → issue closed  
- **Cycle Time** → Development start → merge  
- **Reopen Rate** → Number of issues reopened  
- **Deployment Frequency**

### How I Handle the Situation
- Review metrics every sprint  
- Identify bottlenecks early (slow reviews, delays)

### Outcome
- Transparency  
- Objective decision-making  
- Continuous improvement

## 3. Improve Pace & Efficiency

### Approach
- Allocate focused time for weekly breakdowns  
- Reduce interrupting work  
- Maintain clear priorities  
- Enforce work-in-progress (WIP) limits  
- Track retrospective action items  

### How I Handle the Situation
- Weekly task breakdowns with clear priorities  
- Pause new tasks when too many are in progress  
- Ensure retrospective actions are tracked and implemented  
- Fix process issues instead of pushing people harder  

### Outcome
- Higher productivity  
- Less burnout  
- Better quality output

## 4. Automatic Issue Fixing via GitHub

### Approach
- Raise issues in a standard format  
- Automate repetitive processes wherever possible  

### How I Handle the Situation
- Ensure every issue includes:
  - Clear description  
  - Proper labels  
  - Acceptance criteria  

### How I Behave Smartly
- Reduce manual follow-ups  
- Let systems handle repetitive work  

### Process I Use / Improve
- GitHub Actions:
  - Auto-run tests  
  - Auto-lint code  
  - Auto-close issues (`Fixes #123`)  
  - Auto-labels (`bug`, `urgent`, `blocked`)  

### Outcome
- Faster issue resolution  
- Fewer human errors  
- Scalable issue management

## 5. Agent-Based GitHub Tracking & Documentation

### Approach
- Treat documentation as a continuous process  
- Use agents to reduce employee effort  

### How I Handle the Situation
- Employees provide raw inputs  
- Agents convert inputs into structured documentation  

### Process I Use / Improve
- Enhance existing GitHub documentation with:
  - Sprint summaries  
  - Metrics documents  
  - Research documents  
  - Daily updates  
  - Design and architecture documents  

### Outcome
- Strong knowledge base  
- Faster onboarding  
- Better decision tracking

## 6. Sprint Release Management

### Motto
- Zero-delay sprint releases  

### Approach
- Parallel execution across teams  

### Week 1: Planning & Development

**QA Responsibilities**
- Review requirements  
- Prepare test cases  
- Set up test environments  
- Automate test scripts  
- Define acceptance criteria  

**DevOps Responsibilities**
- Maintain CI/CD pipelines  
- Ensure build stability  
- Ensure environment readiness  
- Define rollback strategies  
- Continuously improve the system  

### How I Behave Smartly
- QA and DevOps work ahead of development, not after  
- Prevent issues early instead of reacting late  

### Week 2: Stabilization & Release

**Developers’ Role**
- Start studying the next sprint  
- Fix bugs and hotfixes  
- Optimize and improve code  
- Perform unit testing  
- Update documentation  
- Monitor production logs  

### How I Handle the Situation
- Ensure developers are never idle  
- Maintain smooth and predictable releases  

### Outcome
- Stable releases  
- Minimal production issues  
- Continuous delivery

## 7. Standardization of GitHub and Documentation

### Approach
- Introduce default templates for all documents  
- Enforce a standard GitHub repository structure  

### How I Handle the Situation
- Roll out default templates  
- Enforce structure across all repositories  

### How I Behave Smartly
- Reduce confusion and dependency on individuals  

### Outcome
- Faster onboarding  
- Clean repositories  
- Scalable development  

---

## 8. Peer Reviews in All-Hands Sessions

### Approach
- Build a culture of constructive feedback  
- Ensure every review includes:
  - 1 positive point  
  - 1 actionable suggestion  

### How I Handle the Situation

- Ensure agents are easy to use and integrated with existing tools (GitHub, Docs, CRM)
- Provide clear usage guidelines and examples
- Gradually increase agent responsibility based on maturity

### How I Behave Smartly
