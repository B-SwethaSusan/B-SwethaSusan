forma co 4
doing models 
delay because - works out of milestones, issue solving


Gopi:
y:
had meeting with gitam professor
implemented ml models for ns3 and ns5 datasets using multiple features and approaches
tested and optimized the screening tools

t:
screening completed, needed to test
cpu- gpu converted, validate the results
work ankith gives
implementation of scaling

issues:
coordination is good
tools- 40+ in boltchem
tools- 6
testing all inputs
laptop issues 
works are time consuming

run 5 different tools for GRNA
filtered them based on the results and objectives
changed the architecture of half life model
run the model on weekend
explored the tools
found a reference research paper but it is old

t:
analyse reference values and compare with the paper
validation of results and document

maria:
y:
researchin on case study for Mran
generated wih the results of tools in the platform

t:

Gayathri:not tested
y:
Attended meeting with Dr. Abhijit (SRM) about the DBT AI grant proposal.
Read papers suggested by sir for the grant.
Recorded video demo of omics agent for business team

t:
submitting grant for klu should submitted
another grant should write up
start doing benchmsrking


issues:
things should improve the make better
agent shhould be updated
need a dedicated person for ai
lack of documentation- for deployment
equal responsibility
claude code usage explanation- workshop
pipielines-5 for testing

asritha:
y:
Exploerd and worked on kicad MCP (https://github.com/mixelpixx/KiCAD-MCP-Server), solved issues and connected mcp to claudecode
Testing agent and solving codegen issues
Building planner agent for frramework version2 and exploring ways to integrate skills version2

t:
old code agent issues solving
building new agent framework
research on new skills injection
following claude a style

issues:
work is good
node server issues
modells not working properly
some models dont give reasoning properly

Roopesh:
y:
Successfully build sandboxed docker for the new framework.
Working on the active_request option of the previous codegenagent will finish it by today.

t:
finding gpu s for proposal
Working on the active_request option of the previous codegenagent will finish it by today.

issues:
memory keep for agent
new features time taken
if one work sir said to stop , we are stoping and focusing on the other, 


Akshith:
y:
Sorted some issues with the old framework, faced issues like unusual behaviour of LLMs
Tried running some testcases with them and some changes were made like prompt updation,etc

t:
working on second frame work
if issues in 1st framework will solve the issues

issues:
present agent is good
problem with llm
facing issues with nodes
architecture defects, problem with tools- give current status
deadlines are not realistic

manjunath:
y:
Manjunath

worked on the docker testing issue for the thermal solver researched about the em simulation system arch

t:

jathin:
Divya

solving docker issues for thermal simulation

t:
working on schematic generation

issues:
issues rectifying
problem while data scraping because of permission
need to gain knowledge on the work

jeevan:
y:
completed credit system

t:
integrate new features in platform

no issues

Manjunath:
issues only while working
platform have several improvements
everything is ok 
if delayed beacuse of errors while working , again need to solve and execute we dont know how exactly the work will go on as expected.
