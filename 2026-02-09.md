work on scerening
do rambabu sir work

Shradha:
finish case study- doing 2nd
Check api workflow

RNA Bolt:network issue
Imran:
y:
more learning on GRna
Rhofold issue was mostly fixed
validating results
researched some tools of Grna
found 2 tools for GRna design
currently go in deeper for that subject

t:
I go deep to understand the ttols
run second case study 
complete the 1 workflow


Maria:

Grna case study

Boltpro:Boltz2 running
laxmi:
Analysed binding interactions, aggregation propensity, and immunogenicity for DV87.1 variants; shortlisted and finalised 5 lead sequences.
Analysed interactions of P-P complexes from RF Diffusion
Provided large datasets for testing
Researched scFv computational design and optimisation pipelines, compiling relevant tools and workflows for future implementation.
t:
researching on single chain SEFE and designing pipeline

Dileep:
Implemented the SE(3)-Bind model, executed inference on a small set of samples, and analyzed the resulting predictions.
Studied and implemented Prodigy, and evaluated by running sample inputs through the pipeline.
Reviewed the PxDesign paper and corresponding codebase to understand the underlying methodology and design choices.
Set up and implemented the PxDesign framework within the system environment.
t:
run px design pipeline
benchmarking on RF3 design

Jyothi:
Ran PRODIGY and ipSAE, extracted Boltz2 results, and combined all outputs into a unified results set.
Based on PRODIGY scores, contact residues, and ipSAE, shortlisted 5 sequences with mutations occurring in the HCDR3 region.
Extracted the mutated sequences from DiffAb-generated output PDB files.
Ran the SPURS tool to compute ΔΔG values for the extracted mutations.

Analyzed the correlation between SPURS and StabDDG; observed weak overall correlation with some positive correlation trends.

Shortlisted stabilizing mutations (ΔΔG < 0.5) from SPURS results and provided them as input to Boltz2 for further evaluation

METRA 4

METRA 4 work has been completed.

Code has been committed to GitHub.

Repository has been shared with the team for review.

Team is currently reviewing the METRA coding application.

Stakeholder Meeting

A meeting was scheduled with the 4C team.

The meeting was declined by the stakeholders.

Need to reconnect and reschedule the call.

Working on getting availability for another discussion.

SRM Work

Had a discussion with Naveen and Sarath yesterday.

Finalized the approach for the SRM-related work.

Reviewing project tasks and overall plan.

Target is to have at least an MVP ready by the end of this week.

Task Assignment

Tasks will be assigned to Saipriya and Niharika so they can start work.

Arnav will also be involved in the implementation.

MSC Call Handling

Discussed MSC call handling with Arnav.

Asked Arnav to prepare a deployment node.

Arnav is currently working on the deployment setup.

Next Steps

Start working on SRM application preparation.

Prepare and update the detailed task list.

Share task updates with the team.

Sai priya:
updates
Working on the Madra Coding App web application.
Sir has committed a few new changes to the repository.
Currently testing and reviewing the new changes.
Specifically reviewing how the confidence threshold is working and validating its behavior.

Niharika:
Reviewing the latest updates that have been completed and committed to GitHub.
Currently testing the METRA code to understand and verify how it is working.
Completed data scraping work for the assigned task.
That’s all for today’s update.

Arnav:
curating deployment doc aws agent
shaed 1st draft of the project
discussed oon phone call echo system 
features and changes, 
check ho can we integrate into pipeline 
move it to rest overall latency of pipeline
having some audio generation pipeline
