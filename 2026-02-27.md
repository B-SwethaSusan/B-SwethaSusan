Esther:weekly content, after deployment a video
y:
Testing transition state calculations with MLIPs integration.
Trying to solve the mds issue.

t:
Test ts
MDS resolving

Durga:

going through literature


Boltzyme:
srivani:
y:
Finalised 4 new workflows from benchmarking paper.
Found SN2 angle error in the RFd2 pipeline output and started working on it with Rajesh. Did research and finally made some changes in the pipeline and reset the angle.

Vyshnavi:
y:
Team Discussions
Prepared paper for the session
Solved errors in pipeline
Helped agents for env setup

t:

nxt sprint plan:
models:
which models need fine tuning, improved
sequence. structure, function
how are we building hypothesis
chemistry focused

Boltchem:
gopi:
y:
generated molecules from 3/4 structure based + pharmacophore models models
tested 1/4 models and analyzed the result.

Shradha:
y:


next sprit:
research on hypothesis
other methods came out
how we are fine tuning
verifiability
update models
setting up pmo package and running 


RNA Bolt:
send hypothesis - analyse then experimentation
documentation and videos
benchmarking
understand the code
send details of GRNA
objectives in sirna we can get and we don't get
aptamer case studies

Boltpro:
Share the benchmarks
3 tools given to frontend
nano bodies peptides


Rebolt:
deep research module deployment
go with patent extraction


PCB design:
autopile used for generation
send algorithms found
agents workflow screen and skills improvement
pcb schema gen- code run and give schematics
try for small circuits
how it shows from datasheet id key component


Agents:
combined end to end running
study open claw
automatiic skill creation
life science research all directions pushing
how do we build open claw system for life sciences

baremetal notes- cpu,gpu configuration, minimum gpu nodes for L&T

Samitha:
send the document


QA: give by monday
api testing
edge case
test cases for all tools
